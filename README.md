# Math-Misc

- CSE.java : pass a string through main method and get it displayed in a cool matrix manner
- Circle.java : prints a circle using parametric equations
- Patterns.java : lots of random patterns and waves
- ProgressBar.java : updates with random values
- TimeC.java : displays time between same task done by 2 different methods
- chase_01.java : full degree of freedom
- chase_02.java : limited degree of freedom (surrounding tiles only)
- Spiral.java : prints an Archimedean spiral
- DampingWave.java : prints a damping wave according to the formula `y(x, t) = A * e^(-δt) * sin(kx - ωt + φ)`
- mtCircle.java : prints a circle with randomizing effect on the inner content of the circle, also has a gradient visual effect
- mtCircle.cpp : C++ version of mtCircle.java, you can also replace GreyscaleCharSequence with just a single `"."` to make it look pleasing
- AngledWave.cpp : Prints an animated angled sine wave by rotating the X-Y plane using basic sin-cos equations, (also another normal sine wave with it)
- CSE.cpp : Recreated my string effect java code with C++, also i didn't want to use any extra libraries so created the random number generator manually. (Cool String Effect)
